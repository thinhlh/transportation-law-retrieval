00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:00,989
It is 11st January

2
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:02,144
2023

3
00:00:02,144 --> 00:00:04,454
and you are watching the research paper

4
00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:06,434
presentation at ICARRT.

5
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:11,186
We are a group of four authors represent
for University of Information Technology.

6
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:13,694
Nowadays, almost every adult has their own

7
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,763
vehicle,
especially in developing countries.

8
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,842
In 2022, there are millions

9
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:22,835
traffic law violations,
with more than 14,000 traffic accidents

10
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:26,894
resulted in roughly
6,500 deaths and a vast injured people.

11
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,016
The reason for this case

12
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:31,514
is that citizens have incredibly low
awareness of the traffic regulations.

13
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:34,682
Moreover,
there are thousands of traffic rules

14
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:36,332
that could be challenging for drivers

15
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:40,193
readers to gain a deep understanding
about transportation law

16
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:43,757
with a strong desire to support citizens
in achieving fundamental knowledge

17
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,605
about law, concepts and penalties.

18
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:48,542
We propose a paper Ontology-based solution
for building

19
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:51,578
an intelligent searching system
on traffic law documents.

20
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:54,449
Our primary mission is to design a system
that has the ability

21
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,244
to search for penalties, fines
and concepts for road traffic offences.

22
00:00:58,244 --> 00:01:00,092
based on the questions given by users.

23
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:03,689
Here are the features of our system.

24
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,778
Q&A System.

25
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:07,319
We will collect the questions from the users and return a list of articles 

26
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,718
based on their ranking in similarity
with the queries extensibility,

27
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:13,754
we developed a subsystem
that could extract and retrieve knowledge

28
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,899
from law documents and questions
automatically.

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,595
This would lead
the intelligent keeps learning over time.

30
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:20,717
Usability

31
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:23,225
Our model propose
a high usability since the content

32
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,413
is served over the internet
without any further installation

33
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,954
is served over the internet
without any further installation

34
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,703
in order to achieve the requirements,

35
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:32,267
we have adopted Traffic-Rela model
based on the rela model.

36
00:01:32,267 --> 00:01:34,874
It is an effective ontology
for representing the knowledge

37
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:38,603
of relations in legal domain
and is a combination of three components.

38
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,682
Let's dive into this model.

39
00:01:40,682 --> 00:01:44,675
The Traffic-Rela model has the following
structure C, R and Rules.

40
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:47,480
C is a set of concepts in traffic domain.

41
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,407
R Is the set of relations between concepts
or fact rules.

42
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:52,859
Represents the inference rules

43
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:56,060
to specify the relation between concepts
and penalties.

44
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,852
Concept

45
00:01:56,852 --> 00:02:01,769
Each C and concept has the structure, name
meaning, attributes and keywords.

46
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,112
Name is the name of the concept.

47
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:06,224
Meaning is the meaning of the concept

48
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:09,227
Attributes is a list of attributes of concept

49
00:02:09,227 --> 00:02:12,164
Keywords is a list of keywords
related to the concept.

50
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:18,071
For example, the concept Electric
Motorcycle will be described as follow

51
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,688
Relation

52
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:22,625
Each relations between concepts in R has the structure

53
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,892
name, conc, meaning, props and keywords.

54
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,004
Name is the name of the relation.

55
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,139
Conc is a list of parameters
as concepts of the relation.

56
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,010
Meaning is the meaning of the relation.

57
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,287
Props are the properties of relations.

58
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:39,191
Keywords
a list of keywords of the relation.

59
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:43,547
Take this comply relation as the example.

60
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:47,605
Rules each rule are in rules
as the form u(r)->v(r).

61
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:49,552
Where u(r) is the hypothesis facts

62
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:53,050
and v(r) is the result of rule r

63
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,393
rules could be the combination
of two different rules types

64
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:56,845
infer and offence

65
00:02:56,845 --> 00:03:00,838
rule infer is a set of rules
inferring the relation between concepts.

66
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:04,303
Rule offences is a set of rules
determining the offences and penalties.

67
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:07,966
Following is our searching system
on the traffic knowledge domain developed

68
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,088
based on the model described

69
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,243
To begin with,

70
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:13,312
user will start by entering
traffic questions.

71
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:16,711
These queries will be extracted,
classified and augmented before

72
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:19,384
transmitted to the traffic law model.

73
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,288
This model will combine processed keywords
along with knowledge

74
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:25,753
base collected from documents and lawyers
to return relevant raw results.

75
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,733
It then will ranking these raw results

76
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:30,835
and transform to readable response
before return to the users.

77
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:33,772
Here is our example
for the searching system

78
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:37,336
with different types of queries
in realistic.

79
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:42,055
Thank you for your watching
and see you in the next videos.
